    <h1>You Shook Me All Night Long</h1>
<h3 id="history">Band History</h3>
    <p>"You Shook Me All Night Long" is a song by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, from the album Back in Black. The song also reappeared on their later album Who Made Who. It is AC/DC's first single with Brian Johnson as the lead singer, replacing Bon Scott who died of alcohol poisoning in February 1980. It reached number 35 on the USA's Hot 100 pop singles chart in 1980. The single was re-released internationally in 1986, following the release of the album Who Made Who. The re-released single in 1986 contains the B-side(s): B1. "She's Got Balls" (Live, Bondi Lifesaver '77); B2. "You Shook Me All Night Long" (Live '83 – 12-inch maxi-single only).</p>
<h3 id="critical">Critical Reception</h3>
    <p>"You Shook Me All Night Long" placed at number 10 on VH1's list of "The 100 Greatest Songs of the 80s". It was also number 1 on VH1's "Top Ten AC/DC Songs". Guitar World placed "You Shook Me All Night Long" at number 80 on their "100 Greatest Guitar Solos" list.</p> 

       <p>Rock critic Robert Christgau regarded it as a "drum-hooked fucksong" and the band's "only great work of art"</p>
<h3 id="controversy">Controversy</h3>
    <p>There have been several claims made over decades that (at least) some parts of the lyrics to the song were written by Bon Scott.</p>

    <p>Silver Smith, late former girlfriend of Bon Scott, interviewed by Jesse Fink for his biography of Scott, Bon: The Last Highway, said: 'I know for sure that [the song] was written at [my flat in] Gloucester Road [in Kensington, London] back in ’76. "She told me to come but I was already there" – he wrote that in a letter to somebody, one of his grotty mates, just after we got together, actually. He always kept notebooks and added and subtracted to them and so on. He put in "American thighs" even way back then, because that was the market they were going to try and crack. So that was written a long time ago.’ In the same book, Scott's girlfriend in Miami, Florida, a woman under the pseudonym 'Holly X', says the original lyric 'chartreuse eyes' was changed to 'sightless eyes' and that she had a horse called Doubletime. The lyrics 'working double time on the seduction line' appear in the finished song.</p>
        
    <p>Doug Thaler, Bon's friend and AC/DC's booking agent on their American tours, also says: 'I don’t care who tells me anything different: you can bet your life that Bon Scott wrote the lyrics to "You Shook Me All Night Long". It's Bon Scott's lyrics all over the place.</p>

    <p>From AC/DC: Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be by Mick Wall: 'However Malcolm Dome claims that shortly before he died, Bon "shoved me his book of lyrics. He had sheets of lyrics that he kept in a file, carried them around. He’d been showing me some of the ideas he’d been working for Back in Black. Not the song 'Back in Black' but songs that were for the next album. There were a couple of lines, like, 'She told me to come but I was already there', which ended up in 'You Shook Me All Night Long' - that’s a Bon lyric. And I saw it. I saw it written down. There were lyrics, lines used, on Back in Black that Bon wrote. [But] he wasn’t credited and to this day no one’s really sure what happened. I don’t think he even got close to finishing the whole songs. But there are lines in there that I know.</p>

    <p>Malcolm Dome again in Classic Rock, August 2005, pg. 46: ‘Bon proudly showed me some of the scribbles he’d put down in preparation for an album he felt would define AC/DC - and open up new possibilities as well. It’s hard to be absolutely accurate from a distance of quarter of a century, and through the haze of alcohol which enveloped the night, but one line sticks in my mind as being on one of those sheets: “She told me to come, but I was already there.” A renowned lyric from the song You Shook Me All Night Long, it has Bon's trademark all over it - a neatly worked double entendre that fits in with the track record of a man who wrote Big Balls, The Jack and other similarly styled songs.</p>
